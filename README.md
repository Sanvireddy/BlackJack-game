# BlackJack-game

It is a simple BlackJack game played by you and a dealer. Whenever we click the hit/stand button, it randomly chooses a deck of cards and displays it on your/dealer flexbox. The player who scores nearer to 21 will be the winner. If the score exceeds 21, it will bust! If the scores of both the players are equal, they drew. 
Features:
  1. You can't score anymore once the dealer starts playing i.e. you cannot click the hit button after hitting the stand button. 
  2. You can click the 'deal ' button only after the winner is declared.
Some more features are yet to come :)
  1. Trying to automate it so that it generates cards by itself for every second.
